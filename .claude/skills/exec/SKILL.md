name: exec
description: Execute a Claude Code ticket end to end and open a pull request for review, on behalf of the cc-exec role. Use this whenever running the exec routine, or when a ticket carries the label cc-exec in Todo and no other cc-exec ticket is In Progress — run the work against the connected repo, open a PR (never merge), then hand off to cc-qa and In Review. Apply this so the lock, handoff, blocked, and gate discipline stay consistent. Trigger it whenever the task is to implement, build, or fix a Linear-tracked ticket with Claude Code.

# exec

The execution role of the Claude Code loop. Runs as a polling Cloud Routine against a connected GitHub repo. Follows `linear-conventions`, Pattern A, and the gate policy. **Never merges — merge is Aled's alone.**

## Trigger

Poll for issues carrying label `cc-exec` in **Todo**, delivery projects only — never the Pipeline team. **Skip the run only if a `cc-exec` ticket is already In Progress** — that means another exec run is active, and the rule is one Claude Code agent per repo. In Progress is the *active-run* signal: tickets parked in **In Review** (awaiting QA, PM, or Aled) are not In Progress and never hold off a run.

A run is **not** a single ticket. It works the eligible `cc-exec` queue **serially — one ticket fully finished before the next is claimed** — until no eligible ticket remains or the run nears its time budget (see Behaviour). Across a run only one ticket is In Progress at any instant; across the repo only one run is active at a time.

**Eligibility scan.** Before each claim — the first and every subsequent one in the run — scan candidates from highest priority downward:

- A ticket is **eligible** if it is a **leaf ticket** (never `type:epic` — epics are outcomes, closed by Aled when their children are done; see linear-conventions *Structure*), has no open blocked-by relation (blocker ticket not Done or Canceled), has no unmet dependency named in a PM comment, and has no existing `claude/<ticket-id-lowercase>` branch in the target repo (a branch indicates a previous or concurrent exec session has already claimed it — skip to prevent duplicate PRs).
- If the top ticket is ineligible, move down the priority list rather than ending the run.
- If no eligible ticket exists, end the run cleanly with no claim. Do not mark anything Blocked.

## Behaviour

A run is a loop. **Repeat the cycle below for one eligible ticket at a time, highest priority first, until no eligible ticket remains or the run nears its time budget.** Each ticket is carried fully through handoff before the next is claimed — strictly serial, so only one ticket is In Progress at any instant.

For each ticket:

1. **Sync** — fetch and check out latest `main`, then cut a fresh `claude/`-prefixed branch for *this* ticket off it. Every ticket gets its own branch off current `main`, never off a previous ticket's branch (genuine dependencies are blocked-by relations, so a blocker is already merged before its dependent is eligible). The branch name for each ticket should be `claude/<ticket-id>` (e.g. `claude/app-144`). When the session provides a pre-generated branch name, use it for the first ticket only; cut a fresh `claude/<ticket-id>` branch off `origin/main` for every subsequent ticket in the same run.
2. **Claim** — move the ticket to In Progress and **clear the assignee**. This *is* the lock: a ticket In Progress under `agent:cc-exec` is being worked and is never re-grabbed. No separate lock label.
3. Read the ticket, its embedded acceptance criteria (Pattern A), any PM comment, and — if this is a bounce — Aled's note. When a ticket creates a new skill, two file locations are required (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and `public/downloads/<name>.md`); see operating-model *How they bundle*. Also add a row to the `CLAUDE.md` skills table. When a criterion references a Sanity field (`siteSettings`, a schema type, or a GROQ query), read the existing Sanity schema files in the repo to determine whether the field is already defined. If it is not, create it in the schema and seed a default value as part of the implementation — or take the Blocked path if the schema change falls outside this ticket's scope. Never substitute a hardcoded constant for a criterion that explicitly requires a data-layer read.
4. Run Claude Code on this ticket's branch. **Before opening a PR, two gates:**
   - **No duplicate PR.** Check whether an open PR for this ticket already exists (use `list_pull_requests` filtered to the branch name). If one exists on **the same branch**, don't open a second — push new commits to it and continue the handoff using the existing PR. If one exists on **a different branch** for the same ticket (two runs used different branch conventions), post a comment noting the conflict, don't open a second PR, and take the Blocked path.
   - **Green CI.** Determine the repo's required CI checks by reading its `.github/workflows/` file, then run them locally in this order — (a) run the formatter to auto-fix format issues, (b) lint, (c) format-check, (d) type-check, (e) build (not every repo has all five — run exactly the ones CI enforces, not a guess). If a check fails and cannot be made green, do not open a partial PR — take the Blocked path instead.

   Only open the PR when no duplicate exists and all required checks pass. Never merge.

   **PR description — clean-room hygiene.** The PR body may describe what was done and reference the ticket. It must not include the exec session's internal reasoning, design deliberation, or build rationale — qa-review treats the PR description as a claim to verify (not as ground truth), so exec reasoning in the PR body would undermine QA's isolated-inputs constraint.
5. **Rebase before hand-off** — fetch `origin/main`, rebase the branch onto it, resolve any conflicts, and re-run the full CI check set (same checks as step 4) to confirm the PR is clean against the current baseline. Force-push the updated branch. If the rebase produces unresolvable conflicts, or if CI fails and cannot be made green after the rebase, take the Blocked path.
6. **Hand off** — set `agent:cc-qa` (evicts `agent:cc-exec`), move to In Review, **leave the ticket unassigned**, and comment the PR link and a short summary. When calling `save_issue`, pass the **complete** desired label set — `labels` replaces all existing labels, it does not append; read the current labels from the issue first if needed. The assignee stays clear through exec and review; cc-qa assigns Aled once review is done (see qa-review). This keeps "assigned to Aled" meaning "Aled's decision is needed now", not "in flight". Leave a comment for the PM leg where project management is needed.

Then re-run the eligibility scan and take the next ticket. **End the run** when no eligible ticket remains. If the run is nearing its time budget, stop claiming new tickets — but always finish the in-flight ticket's handoff first, so an ending run leaves at most the one ticket it was actively working part-done (the same exposure as a single-ticket run).

**Blocked (fail-safe).** If you hit a blocker you cannot resolve — push rejected / no write access, a missing dependency or credential, or a requirement too ambiguous to act on safely — do **not** leave the ticket In Progress and do **not** open a half-baked PR. Move it to **Blocked**, set priority **Urgent (1)**, set `agent:human` (evicts `agent:cc-exec`), assign Aled, and comment plainly what blocked you and what is needed to clear it. As in step 6, pass the **complete** label set to `save_issue` — `labels` replaces all existing labels, it does not append. This empties In Progress so the leg is not jammed and the next ticket can run, and it surfaces the blocker to Aled. Aled clears the blocker and moves the ticket back to Todo to retry. Within a run, a Blocked outcome ends only *that ticket's* cycle — the run continues to the next eligible ticket. For unexpected errors outside any ticket's scope (infrastructure failures, tool errors, ops-layer gaps), call `issue-capture` to file a Backlog ticket.

**Adding a blocked-by at runtime.** When the blocker is a specific unmerged ticket (a shared-file conflict or an artefact that must exist first), also add a formal `blockedBy` relation from this ticket to the blocking ticket via `save_issue` with `blockedBy: [blocking-ticket-id]`, and note the relation in the blocker comment. This lets pm-merge's unblock-dependents step auto-unblock the ticket once the blocker merges, rather than requiring Aled to move it manually.

**Bounce:** Aled moves In Review → **Todo** with a note; the next run re-picks it and iterates on the existing PR. (Todo, not In Progress, so In Progress always means "running now.")

## Guardrails

- Never merges. Main branch protected; merge is Aled's.
- On an unresolvable blocker, move the ticket to **Blocked**, set priority **Urgent (1)**, set `agent:human`, assign Aled. Never leave it In Progress — that jams the leg and it never retries.
- One PR per ticket. Never open a partial or speculative PR to "make progress" — Blocked is the honest outcome.
- A run works the whole eligible queue, but **serially** — one ticket fully handed off before the next is claimed, each on its own branch off latest `main`. Never run two tickets' branches in one session in parallel; they would collide in the repo.
- Fresh cloud session each run, so all state lives in Linear, not the agent.
- Scope GitHub access to delivery repos only. Never touches the Pipeline team's work.

## Setup

- Deployed as a Claude Code cloud scheduled task (cloud, machine off).
- Connectors: Linear + GitHub. The Claude Code GitHub App must have **Contents: read & write** and **Pull requests: read & write** on the delivery repo — read-only causes a 403 on push, which is a Blocked outcome, not a crash.
- One repo to start; widen once the loop is proven. Cadence: hourly or slower.
- The routine prompt: "Run the exec skill."

> Lock note: this skill and `linear-conventions` both use **status as the lock** (Todo = ready, In Progress = running). No `state:locked` label exists or is needed.

On finish, propose os.Claude Backlog tickets for any friction, per the ops-retro skill.
