description: Review a Claude Code pull request for Aled and write a plain-language verdict he can act on without reading the code. Use this whenever running the qa-review routine, or when a ticket in In Review carries cc-qa — read the PR against the ticket's embedded acceptance criteria and report either a clean summary with DoD confirmation, or the full set of changes the exec agent needs. Apply this rather than reviewing ad hoc; it never merges or advances the ticket. Trigger it whenever the task is to QA, review, or sanity-check agent-written code in a Linear context.

# qa-review

The QA / review role of the Claude Code loop — the extra pair of eyes that makes a change reviewable by Aled without him reading code. Runs as a polling Cloud Routine. Follows linear-conventions and the gate policy (Aled is the approver; nothing merges without him).

## Trigger

Poll for issues in In Review carrying `cc-qa` (set by the exec leg). Delivery projects only.

## Dedup — one review per PR state

Before reviewing, check whether a verdict already exists for the current PR head commit. The check is keyed on the commit SHA, not elapsed time, so qa-review still re-reviews after an In Review → Todo bounce where exec pushes new commits.

1. **Fetch the PR's current head commit SHA.**
2. **Scan existing GitHub PR comments** for any comment that starts with `[qa-review] HEAD: <sha>` where `<sha>` is the current head commit SHA (first 7 characters). Use this as the dedup key.
3. **If a match is found:** skip silently — no comment, no state change. The verdict already exists; Aled's gate is the next action.
4. **If no match:** proceed with the full review below.

Every verdict comment **must** begin with:

```
[qa-review] HEAD: <sha7>
```

where `<sha7>` is the first 7 characters of the PR head commit SHA. This line is the dedup key.

## Behaviour

Read the linked PR / diff and the acceptance criteria embedded in the ticket (Pattern A). Assess the change against those criteria, then:

1. **Post the verdict comment on the Linear ticket** (so it's in the canonical record). Begin the comment with `[qa-review] HEAD: <sha7>`.
2. **Post the same verdict comment on the GitHub PR** (so it's visible where Aled reviews and approves). Begin the comment with `[qa-review] HEAD: <sha7>`.
3. **If the PR is a draft, mark it as Ready for Review** — draft signals WIP; a clean QA pass signals it's awaiting human sign-off. Skip this step if the PR is already non-draft.

Verdict comes in one of two modes:

- **Clean** — a summary of what was done plus explicit confirmation it meets the DoD / success criteria. Enough for Aled to approve.
- **Changes needed** — log everything the exec agent needs to act on: specific, actionable, with file/line where it helps, so a bounce is self-contained. Do not mark the PR ready for review if changes are needed.

Plain language throughout — Aled acts on it without reading the code.

**Hand off to Aled.** Once the verdict is posted (either mode), assign the ticket to **Aled**, leaving the label as `agent:cc-qa` and the state **In Review**. Do **not** switch the label to `agent:cc-pm` — that is Aled's approval action, not QA's, and the ticket stays in the QA lane in case he has follow-ups. Review is done, so the ticket is now genuinely Aled's: he either raises follow-ups (a bounce — In Review → Todo re-triggers exec) or approves by setting `agent:cc-pm` and giving his `@cc-pm` signal, which triggers the pm-merge leg. The exec leg left the ticket unassigned; cc-qa is where the assignee becomes Aled, so "assigned to Aled" reliably means his decision is needed now.

## Guardrails

- Does not merge, does not change the ticket's **state** (stays In Review), and does not change the `agent:*` label (stays `cc-qa`). The one thing it sets is the **assignee → Aled** once the verdict is posted. Switching to `agent:cc-pm` is Aled's approval action, not QA's. It reviews, reports, and hands to Aled; Aled decides.
- Approve and merge are Aled's: his `@cc-pm` approval signal triggers the pm-merge leg. Bounce is Aled's: In Review -> Todo with a note re-triggers exec.
- A QA pass is not assurance — it makes the change legible, it does not sign it off. Sign-off is human (Pattern A).

## Setup

- Claude Code Desktop -> Schedule -> New remote task.
- Connectors: Linear + GitHub (read + write access to the PR for comments and draft conversion).
- Routine prompt: "Run the qa-review skill."
- Load MCP tool schemas via ToolSearch before starting: `select:mcp__Linear__list_issues,mcp__Linear__list_comments,mcp__Linear__list_issue_labels,mcp__Linear__save_comment,mcp__Linear__save_issue` and `select:mcp__github__list_pull_requests,mcp__github__pull_request_read,mcp__github__add_issue_comment`.

On finish, propose os.Claude Backlog tickets for any friction, per the ops-retro skill.
